from gtts import gTTS                                  ##This line imports the gTTS class from the gtts module. gTTS stands for Google Text-to-Speech, and it is used for converting text to speech.
import os                                              ##This line imports the os module, which provides a way to interact with the operating system. In this case, it is used to play the audio file.

mytext = 'hey there! my self bhavish '                 ##: This line defines a variable mytext and assigns it the value 'hey there! my self bhavish'. This is the text that you want to convert to speech.
language = 'en'                                        ##This line defines a variable language and assigns it the value 'en', which represents English. This specifies the language in which the text should be spoken.

myobj = gTTS(text=mytext, lang=language, slow=False)   ##This line creates a new gTTS object called myobj. It takes three arguments:The text that should be converted to speech.The language in which the text should be spoken.Whether the speech should be generated at a slow speed. Setting it to means normal speed.

myobj.save("output.mp3")                               ## This line saves the speech generated by myobj as an audio file named output.mp3 in the current directory.

os.system("start output.mp3")                          ##This line uses the os.system function to execute a system command. In this case, it uses the "start output.mp3" command to open and play the output.mp3 file using the default audio player associated with .mp3 files on your system.
